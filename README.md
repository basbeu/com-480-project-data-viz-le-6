## Milestone 1 (Friday 3rd April, 5pm)

**10% of the final grade**

### 2.1 Dataset
The dataset is extracted from https://www.ski-db.com/ that provide all results of every Ski World Cup race.
The scraping is already done. It will not require a lot of cleaning or data wrangling, as the raw data from the website is exact and without noise or problem. The data will just be put on the most suitable format for our task. 

### 2.2 Problematic
We want to explore the evolution of the alpine ski world cup. Since opening season in 1966, a lot of evolution took place in alpine skiing. For sure this sport evolved with the technology improvement over the years. It grows to have several kind of events all around the world. 
With the historical dataset we want to visualize the evolution during the years.

We would like to visualize :
 - the evolution of the skier profiles through the year
 - geographical representation of the World Cup races
 - animation showing evolutive ranking through the years

### 2.3 Exploratory data analysis

We scraped the data from the women and men world cup and we get those entity : 

Number of seasons  : 54   (all seasons since the beginning)
Number of races    : 3477
Number of athletes : 3137
Number of country  : 77


### 2.4 Related work
There is data available for the results, rankings and athletes profiles, but all are static tables not really convenient to read and some basic static charts. We did not find something similar to what we want to do.
We want to do much more doing dynamic visualization that allow to explore this data smoothly.

- https://www.fis-ski.com : the FIS has results, rankings and athletes records since the begining
- https://www.ski-db.com/ : the website on which we scraped the data also show cool stats and ranking. For example : all time greatest ranking
- http://ski-reference.com/ : website that allow to query FIS website to compare two athletes or analyse the results of one course.
