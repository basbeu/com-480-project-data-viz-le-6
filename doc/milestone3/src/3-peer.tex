\subsection{Bastien Beuchat}

Bastien is the certified web designer of our group.
On top of doing a good chunk of data analysis and his superb similarity graph, linking athletes that perform in similar events, he has also taken on the gargantuan task of linking each component together, integrating them on one web-page and make everything look nice.


\subsection{Eric Joll√®s}

Eric has also a substantial experience with Javascript, being well-versed in Leaflet thanks to his past semester projects and the applied data analysis class.
He has coded the map and the static race classifications, alongside looking for images for each of the more than 200 events scattered across the years and the world.
He has also developed the bar chart race.

\subsection{Robin Mamie}

Robin has taken on the job of looking for, scraping, cleaning and organizing all the datasets used throughout our project.
He has also programmed the athlete profiles, allowing the user to select any athlete from any visualization, or directly looking for them via text, and display their data and statistics.
He has also written and organized the process book, and done the screencast of the project.
