\section{Discussion}

Our \textit{evolution board} fully achieves our initial goal, which is to create original and diverse alpine skiing visualizations.
These allow any user to explore the whole history of the World Cup in an easy and intuitive way.

There are still other ways available to explore the data.
Most notably, an athlete comparison panel could be interesting.
Creating parallels between two champions of two different eras would provide additional information about the evolution of the sport.

The properties of the graph can also be exploited to summarize the style of the skiers throughout their careers, by not only evaluating their specialty, but also how their concurrents evolved at the time.
