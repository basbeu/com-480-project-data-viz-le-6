\section*{Introduction}

The FIS (\textit{fédération internationale de ski}) Alpine Ski World Cup gathers sport fans across the world since 1966.
Famous ski resorts from Argentina and Switzerland to New Zealand and China have hosted these events for more than 50 years.
Although information is readily available on the official FIS website\cite{fis-website} and other third-party, fan-made hubs,\cite{ski-db, ski-reference} these resources fail to provide modern, dynamic and insightful visualizations.

To help providing new investigation angles to followers of the sport, we implement several original visualizations.
A bar chart race shows the evolution of the World Cup overall rankings throughout each season since the beginning.
The location of ski races are shown on an interactive map.
When selected, the race results are shown on another panel.
Skiers can easily be searched in our own database, while graphs retracing their performance season by season are displayed.
Last but not least, a graph shows how professional skiers are \textit{linked} via their specialty, showing that clusters of either versatile, technical or speed skiers exist in each season.

Our work succeeds in providing new insights by simply using simple, existing information on ski races and athletes.
The platform is easily expandable and can be updated in a matter of minutes thanks to our scraping pipeline.
